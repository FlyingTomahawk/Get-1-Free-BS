============
Admin Setup:
============

Open your Admin panel, click on "Catalog", then click on "Get 1 Free" in the box
on the left. This is your admin page for this Addon.

To add a new product to promote, click on the "New Product" button. On the next
screen, select the product that you want to promote from the "Product" dropdown.
Enter the quantity of products that the customer must buy to qualify for one
(or more) free product(s) in the "Quantity to Qualify" box. Enter the maximum
number of free products per order in the "Maximum Free Products" box. If you
don't want to limit then enter a very large number. Select the free product from
the "Free Product" dropdown. Enter the number of free products that you want to
give for each quantity of qualifying products in the Free Product Quantity box.
Enter the date you want the promotion to expire in the "Expiry Date" box, or use
the calendar to select a date. If you don't want the promotion to expire,
you can leave this field blank. Click the "Insert" button when you are done, or
"Cancel" to start over.

To edit a product that you have previously entered, click on the product name to
select it, then click on the "Edit" button. The fields are the same as in the
new product section, except that the product being promoted cannot be changed.

To delete a product that you have previously entered, click on the product name
to select it, then click on the "Delete" button, then click on the "Delete"
button again to confirm.

You can also temporarily disable a promotion by clicking on the red button in
the product row. Click on the green button to enable a previously disabled
product.



================
Bestseller List:
================

This Addon adds free products to your Bestseller list every time a customer
qualifies for one. If you don't want this behaviour, find the following lines in
catalog/checkout_process.php:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      //   Comment out the next line if you don't want free products in the bestseller list
      tep_db_query("update " . TABLE_PRODUCTS . " set products_ordered = products_ordered + " . sprintf('%d', $free_product['quantity']) . " where products_id = '" . tep_get_prid($free_product['id']) . "'");
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


and comment out the second line of that:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      //   Comment out the next line if you don't want free products in the bestseller list
//      tep_db_query("update " . TABLE_PRODUCTS . " set products_ordered = products_ordered + " . sprintf('%d', $free_product['quantity']) . " where products_id = '" . tep_get_prid($free_product['id']) . "'");
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



==============
Catalog Setup:
==============

The code added to catalog/product_info.php and
catalog/includes/languages/english/product_info.php produces a line like this:

Special Limited Offer: Buy 1 Samsung Galaxy Tab and get 1 Beloved free! - Limited time offer ends Saturday 28 February, 2015

This text will display for any product that currently qualifies under your
promotion. You can leave it as is (in which case you can stop reading this section) or
you can change the text to say anything you want by changing the code in
catalog/includes/languages/english/product_info.php. The code looks like this:

define('TEXT_GET_1_FREE_PROMOTION', '<strong>Special Limited Offer:</strong> Buy %u %s and get %u %s free!');
define('TEXT_OFFER_ENDS', ' - Limited time offer ends');

The special characters in the above (%u, %s) get replaced with the variables
in line 133 of catalog/product_info.php. They are substituted in order, so the
first %u becomes the number of products needed to qualify, the following %s
becomes the name of the product, etc. If yo need to change the order of the
variables in the code, you will need to change the order in both files. I used
%u for the numbers and %s for the text, but %s will work well enough for either.

See the "Get 1 Free Mods.txt" file for further improvements to this text.

==============================
Hyperlink in product_info.php:
==============================

The free product name inside the Special Offer message is a hyperlink and will open a new window to it when clicked.
If you want to redirect to the free product in the same, currently opened window remove the target="_blank" code from the code below
inside the product_info.php

echo '<p class="alert alert-success">' . sprintf (TEXT_GET_1_FREE_PROMOTION, $free_product['products_qualify_quantity'], $product_info['products_name'], $free_product['products_free_quantity'],  '<a href="' . tep_href_link(FILENAME_PRODUCT_INFO, 'products_id=' . $free_product['products_free_id']). '" target="_blank">' . $free_product['products_name'] . '</a>');
